# UCUM TypeScript Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the top 3 priority features needed to bring the UCUM TypeScript implementation to production readiness and full compliance.

## 🎯 Top 3 Priority Features

### 1. 🌡️ Special Unit Conversions
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocking 87 tests
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Impact**: Enables temperature, logarithmic, and arbitrary unit conversions

#### Objectives
- Implement temperature conversions (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin)
- Add logarithmic unit support (pH, Bel, Neper)
- Handle arbitrary/special units (mol-mass, equivalents)
- Fix all 87 failing tests

#### Technical Approach
- Create `SpecialConverter` class with conversion registry
- Implement conversion functions for each special unit type
- Integrate with existing converter pipeline
- Add comprehensive tests for edge cases

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ All 613 tests passing (100%)
- ✅ Temperature conversions accurate to 6 decimal places
- ✅ Logarithmic conversions working correctly
- ✅ Special units handle all UCUM test cases

### 2. 📊 Clinical & Common Unit Coverage
**Priority**: HIGH - Required for medical applications
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Impact**: Expands unit coverage from 39.6% to 80%+

#### Objectives
- Add all clinical chemistry units
- Implement US customary units (gallon, pound, mile, etc.)
- Add International Units (IU) for vitamins/hormones
- Include common engineering units

#### Technical Approach
- Parse additional units from ucum-essence.xml
- Generate TypeScript definitions automatically
- Validate against UCUM specification
- Add unit-specific tests

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ 80%+ unit coverage (287+ units)
- ✅ All medical/clinical units implemented
- ✅ Common US units available
- ✅ Generated code passes all validations

### 3. 🧮 Unit Calculator Module
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Advanced feature for unit arithmetic
**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**Impact**: Enables unit multiplication, division, and simplification

#### Objectives
- Multiply and divide unit expressions
- Simplify complex unit expressions
- Perform dimensional analysis
- Support unit equation solving

#### Technical Approach
- Create `UCUMCalculator` class
- Implement unit algebra operations
- Add expression simplification logic
- Integrate with parser and converter

#### Success Criteria
- ✅ Unit multiplication/division working
- ✅ Expression simplification (e.g., m.m → m²)
- ✅ Dimensional analysis for validation
- ✅ Clear API with examples

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Complex special conversions
- **Mitigation**: Incremental implementation with extensive testing

### Schedule Risks
- **Risk**: Underestimated complexity
- **Mitigation**: Buffer time in each sprint

### Quality Risks
- **Risk**: Regression in existing features
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite, CI/CD

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 1000+ weekly downloads
- **Quality**: 100% test coverage
- **Performance**: <5ms for 95% of conversions
- **Community**: 50+ GitHub stars

## Conclusion

This roadmap focuses on the most critical gaps identified in the GAP analysis. By implementing these top 3 features, the UCUM TypeScript library will achieve production readiness and serve as a reliable solution for unit conversion in medical, scientific, and engineering applications.
